## What's Inside

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms that I've been learning and practicing. Most programs are self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.

### Topics Covered

**Arrays & ADT**
- Array operations: search, insert, delete, merge, reverse
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference
- Array ADT implementation

**Linked Lists**
- Display and traversal (iterative and recursive)
- Insertion and deletion operations
- Searching and sorting in linked lists
- Finding max, sum, count operations

**Stacks**
- Array-based implementation
- Linked list-based implementation
- Stack utilities and helpers

**Queues**
- Queue initialization and operations
- Queue implementations

**Strings**
- String length and manipulation
- Case conversion
- Vowel counting
- String reversal (multiple methods)
- String comparison
- Palindrome checking

**Recursion**
- Factorial
- Head and tail recursion
- Sum of first N numbers
- Exponentiation
- Binary search (recursive)
- Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- Practice examples

**Matrices**
- Diagonal matrix operations
- Lower triangular matrix
- Matrix implementations with classes

**Trees**
- Tree traversals (iterative)
- Level order and preorder traversals

**Java Programs**
- Pattern problems
- Fibonacci series
- Number operations: digits, rotation, inverse
- Prime numbers and factorization
- GCD and LCM

## How to Use

### C++ Programs

```bash
# Navigate to any directory with a .cpp file
cd "Linked Lists/inserting-in-linkedlist"

# Compile
g++ inserting-in-linkedlist.cpp -o program

# Run
./program
```

### Java Programs

```bash
# Navigate to any directory with a .java file
cd Java-Programs/fibonacci-series

# Compile
javac fibonacci.java

# Run
java fibonacci
```

## Repository Structure

Programs are organized by topic in separate directories. Each major topic has its own folder, and individual programs are generally in their own subdirectories for better organization.

## Notes

- Most implementations are educational and focus on clarity over optimization
- Some programs may have multiple approaches to the same problem
- Code style may vary as this represents learning progress over time
