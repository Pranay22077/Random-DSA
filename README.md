## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **C++**: GCC compiler or any C++ compiler

### Running the Programs

#### For Java Programs:
```bash
# Navigate to the specific folder
cd "pattern problems"

# Compile the Java file
javac pattern_1.java

# Run the compiled program
java pattern_1
```

#### For C++ Programs:
```bash
# Navigate to the recursion folder
cd recursion

# Compile the C++ file
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial

# Run the executable
./factorial
```

## 📖 Usage

Each folder contains programs related to specific topics. Browse through the folders to find the implementation you're interested in. Most programs are self-contained and can be run independently.
