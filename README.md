# Random DSA

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in Java and C++. This repository contains various fundamental programming problems and their solutions, perfect for learning and practicing DSA concepts.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository includes implementations for the following topics:

- **Pattern Problems** - Various star and number pattern printing programs
- **Fibonacci Series** - Fibonacci sequence generation implementations
- **Recursion** - Recursive algorithms including:
  - Factorial calculation
  - Head Recusrion
  - Tail Recursion
  - Sum of first N numbers
- **Prime Numbers** - Prime factorization and prime/composite checking
- **Number Operations**:
  - Digit extraction from numbers
  - Number rotation
  - Inverse of a number
  - GCD and LCM calculations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **C++**: GCC compiler or any C++ compiler

### Running the Programs

#### For Java Programs:
```bash
# Navigate to the specific folder
cd "pattern problems"

# Compile the Java file
javac pattern_1.java

# Run the compiled program
java pattern_1
```

#### For C++ Programs:
```bash
# Navigate to the recursion folder
cd recursion

# Compile the C++ file
g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial

# Run the executable
./factorial
```

## 📖 Usage

Each folder contains programs related to specific topics. Browse through the folders to find the implementation you're interested in. Most programs are self-contained and can be run independently.
